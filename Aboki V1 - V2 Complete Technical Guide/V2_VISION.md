# Aboki V1 → V2 Architecture  
## Part 2: V2 — The Persistent Financial Platform

Aboki V2 is not a conversion tool.  
It's a **financial home**, where users:

- Store value  
- Send money  
- Pay merchants  
- Interact socially  
- Live inside the ecosystem

---

## V2 Mental Model
V2 is **Cash App / Venmo**, not a currency booth.

- Persistent balances  
- Social payments  
- Merchant payments  
- Smart contract accounts under the hood  
- Blockchain fully abstracted away

Users think they're using a **fintech app**.  
Inside: they’re using programmable wallets on Base.

## Core Transformation:  
### EOAs → Smart Contract Accounts

- V1 users had EOAs  
- V2 users have **Smart Contract Accounts**

Unlocks:
- Gasless transactions  
- Biometric authentication  
- Spending limits  
- Social recovery  
- No seed phrases  
- Programmable wallet logic
